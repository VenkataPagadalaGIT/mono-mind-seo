# Mono Mind SEO — Migration PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Migrate the Lovable.dev repo `https://github.com/VenkataPagadalaGIT/mono-mind-seo` to Emergent's stack.

User explicitly chose **Option A: Next.js + FastAPI + MongoDB** so AI bots (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended) and search engine crawlers can retrieve and rank content — the project is SEO-focused.

## Source Project (as-is)
- **Repo**: VenkataPagadalaGIT/mono-mind-seo (public, TypeScript)
- **Stack**: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + shadcn-ui + Tailwind + Three.js + framer-motion + react-router-dom + react-helmet-async + @tanstack/react-query
- **Purpose**: Personal portfolio / AI knowledge hub for Venkata Pagadala ("Mono Mind")

## Target Stack (implemented)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router) + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn + Three.js + framer-motion
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Motor (async Mongo) + Pydantic v2 + bcrypt + PyJWT + Resend
- **DB**: MongoDB (collections: contact_submissions, newsletter_subscribers, admin_users, contributors, ai_updates, pillars, posts)

## Personas
- **Owner (Venkata Pagadala)** — uses /admin to monitor contacts, subscribers, content stats; receives contact emails via Resend
- **Human visitors** — read insights, AI Contributors encyclopedia, send enquiries, subscribe
- **AI crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, etc.)** — retrieve SSR HTML + per-page JSON-LD for AI search answers
- **Search engine bots (Googlebot, Bingbot)** — crawl dynamic sitemap (160+ URLs) with per-post Article JSON-LD

## What's Been Implemented

### Iteration 27 — Jeff Coyle "From Showing Up to Winning" + Day 1 complete (2026-04-28)
**User goal:** Publish the Day 1 closing keynote — Jeff Coyle's "From Showing Up to Winning: An IR & Systems-Level View of AI Search" (4:30 PM) with 5 image artifacts (speaker on stage + 4 slides: AI search pipeline, What winning content looks like, 01–06 diagnostic ladder, 2-page reference guide QR).

**What's new:**
- Production note: 2,357 words / 10 min read at session ID `monday-april-27-2026-4-30-pm-from-showing-up-to-winning-an-ir-systems-level-view-of-ai-search` (`is_public: true`, `status: Published`).
- 7 takeaways stored on the record.
- 5 contextually-placed images:
  - Jeff on stage (`xx16gerj_IMG_2610.jpg`) → top, after key thesis
  - "The AI search pipeline" Crawl→Cite diagram (`j1ejtook_IMG_2613.jpg`) → in "Stop measuring outputs" reframe
  - "What winning content looks like" 5-pillar slide (`bw6dahff_IMG_2614.jpg`) → in editorial-excellence section
  - "01 Eligibility → 06 Outcome" diagnostic ladder (`f8opv7zr_IMG_2615.jpg`) → in "Where you actually lose, in order"
  - "Download the 2-page reference guide" QR slide (`vr1v8hpv_IMG_2616.jpg`) → in resource section at bottom
- Skipped IMG_2611/2612 (not uploaded — only 5 of 7 ordinals provided).

**Day 1 of SEO Week 2026 is complete on production** — 11 sessions published (Welcome + Mike King ×2, Krishna Madhavan, Andrea Volpini, Annie Cushing, Dale Bertrand, Jori Ford, Metehan Yeşilyurt, Scott Stouffer, Jeff Coyle). Total ~17,000 words of long-form field notes, fully indexed, with JSON-LD `Event` schema per session and clean URL slugs.

### Iteration 26 — Scott Stouffer centroid/clusters note published (2026-04-28)
**User goal:** Publish Scott Stouffer's "Your Brand Is a Mathematical Object: Centroids, Clusters, and the Retrieval Boundary" (Day 1 · 4:00 PM, agenda title "Is AI Seeing the Brand You Think You've Built?") with his 2 image artifacts (speaker on stage + the "stabilize your centroid" closing slide).

**What's new:**
- Production note: 1,752 words / 8 min read at session ID `monday-april-27-2026-4-00-pm-is-ai-seeing-the-brand-you-think-you-ve-built` (`is_public: true`, `status: Published`).
- 7 takeaways (centroid is what AI calculates, retrieval before ranking, "not retrieved equals does not exist", cluster collision, distinct centroid wins, continuous-control loop, "was I eligible?" replaces "why didn't I rank?").
- 2 contextually-placed images after content-verification:
  - Scott on stage (`b762bz2a_IMG_2608.jpg`) → top, after key thesis
  - "You must STABILIZE your centroid / Not just OPTIMIZE pages" slide (`bymy73ez_IMG_2609.jpg`) → in "What actually wins" section
- Skipped the user's notes-doc screenshot (s7owdtlr_image.png) — already transcribed.

**URL slug note:** the urlSlug is generated from `_slug(s.title)` where apostrophes split into dashes — so `You've` becomes `you-ve`, not `youve`. Correct production URL: `/sessions/is-ai-seeing-the-brand-you-think-you-ve-built` (not `youve-built`). Saving to test-credentials notes for future publishes.

**Verified:** Page renders at production with both images, takeaways, and all 9 sections.

### Iteration 25 — Metehan Yeşilyurt entropy-game note published (2026-04-28)
**User goal:** Publish Metehan Yeşilyurt's "Everything Is an Entropy Game: What Dies Between Retrieval and Citation" (Session 9, Day 1 · 3:30 PM) with all 5 image artifacts placed contextually.

**What's new:**
- Production note: 1,776 words / 8 min read at session ID `monday-april-27-2026-3-30-pm-everything-is-an-entropy-game-what-dies-between-retrieval-and-citation` (`is_public: true`, `status: Published`).
- 7 takeaways stored on the record.
- Full structure: TL;DR → SEOs as entropy managers → Do AI engines read every page? → Retrieval flow → Tokenizers → Embeddings/Rerankers (with Reranker Weights table breakdown + Made-Up Brand Competition results) → Common Crawl → Quotes → My take → Open questions → Action items → People to follow up.
- 4 of 5 images embedded after content-verifying each artifact (lesson learned from the prior bug):
  - Title slide (`qj362kdl_IMG_2602.jpg`) → top of note
  - Speaker on stage (`61mkqzeh_IMG_2603.jpg`) → after the framing intro
  - Reranker Weights slide (`8ohcw1lf_IMG_2606.jpg`) → in Embeddings/Rerankers section (the wider/clearer angle of the two duplicate angles)
  - Made-Up Brand Competition results (`8mc7n0m5_IMG_2607.jpg`) → entity authority subsection
  - Skipped duplicate angle of reranker slide (`lzp13iua_IMG_2605.jpg`) since IMG_2606 was clearer.

**Verified:** Page renders at production with all 4 images correctly placed, takeaways list, TOC entries, and 1,776-word body.

### Iteration 24 — Jori Ford HEO note published + image-URL bug fix (2026-04-28)
**User goal:** Publish Jori Ford's "HEO: The Hybrid Engine Score" notes from the Monday afternoon block at SEO Week 2026, with speaker photo + key slide ("Two Overrides That Beat the Aggregate Score") embedded inline.

**What's new:**
- Production note created for session ID `monday-april-27-2026-2-30-pm-heo-the-hybrid-engine-score` (`is_public: true`, `status: Published`).
- 1,675 words / 7 min read, full structure: TL;DR → Reframe → Tooling noise → Scorecard design principles → Crawler PSA → Five signals → Seed-question set → Worked example (Presence math) → Strategic profiles → Monday-morning diagnostic loop → Two overrides → Worked case → Quotes → My take → Open questions → Action items.
- 7 takeaways stored on the note record.
- Two contextual images embedded:
  - Speaker on-stage photo at top, after "Key thesis" → `9yd1c5yq_IMG_2600.jpg`
  - "Two Overrides That Beat the Aggregate Score" slide under the Monday-morning diagnostic loop → `wpetmcjr_IMG_2601.jpg`

**Bug fixed during this iteration:**
- Initial publish accidentally used the wrong image URL pair — the asset CDN labels (`ygs908re_image.png`, `9yd1c5yq_IMG_2600.jpg`, `wpetmcjr_IMG_2601.jpg`) didn't match their visual content. The note doc screenshot was being rendered at the top, and the on-stage photo was being rendered under "Two Overrides". User reported the bug at `https://venkatapagadala.com/notebook/conference/seo-week-2026/sessions/heo-the-hybrid-engine-score`. Fix: re-mapped URLs after content-verifying each artifact via `analyze_file_tool` and re-pushed via PUT to `/api/notebook/notes/{slug}/{session_id}`.
- Lesson for future image embedding: always verify artifact contents via image analysis before assuming filename/label matches actual content — the user's labels in the upload message are often correct, but auto-generated CDN slugs (e.g., `image.png` files) need visual confirmation.

**Verified:** Page renders correctly at production domain `venkatapagadala.com` with both images at correct positions (manual screenshot verification at top + at "Override 1" anchor).



### Iteration 23 — Field-notes template + format toolbar (2026-02-27)
**User goal:** A consistent, repeatable format for live conference notes (matching the published reading view's structure: Speaker H2 → Key thesis → H3 sub-sections → arrow takeaways → My take → Open questions).

**What's new:**
- **★ Template button** (emerald accent) in BOTH editors (inline `ConferenceDetail.tsx` + full-page `SessionDetail.tsx`).
- One click scaffolds the entire field-notes structure pre-populated with the session's speaker name and title:
  ```
  ## {Speaker} — {Session Title}
  
  **Key thesis:** ...
  
  ### Context that matters
  ### What {Speaker first name} actually said
  ### Key takeaways
  - takeaway one
  - takeaway two
  ### Quotes worth keeping
  > "..." — {Speaker}
  ### My take
  ### Open questions
  - [ ] ...
  ```
- Confirm dialog if existing content (won't accidentally overwrite).
- Bullet list items render with `→` prefix automatically (already in `NoteContent.tsx` `li` styling).

**Format toolbar additions:**
- `H2`, `H3` (separated for clear hierarchy)
- `→` (one-click takeaway bullet — auto-renders as → arrow)
- `1.` (numbered list)
- `☐` (task / action item)
- `❝` (quote with attribution placeholder)
- `🖼` (image URL prompt)
- `▶` (YouTube/Vimeo URL prompt)
- `🔗` (link with selected text)
- `B` / `I` / `</>` (bold / italic / inline code)
- All buttons have `data-testid` for QA.

**Verified via Playwright:**
- Template button renders in both inline + page editors
- Click opens confirm → on accept, replaces textarea with full template
- Toolbar buttons all visible and clickable
- `Welcome & Opening Remarks` session for Mike King correctly resolves speaker info and bakes it into the template heading.

### Iteration 22 — URL structure overhaul + JSON-LD enrichment (2026-02-27)
**The "worst URL" report:** Conference sessions previously used hash anchors only (`/notebook/conference/seo-week-2026#monday-april-27-2026-9-00-am-the-invisible-converged-web-architecting-...` — 130+ chars, NOT crawlable as a separate URL).

**Fixes applied:**
1. **Dual-key session slug system** in `src/data/conferences.ts`:
   - **Internal `sessionId`** (long form, kept for backward compat with existing notes in MongoDB).
   - **Public `urlSlug`** (clean, derived from session title only) for `/notebook/conference/{conf}/sessions/{slug}` URLs.
   - Collision-safe: appends start time then day index only if needed.
   - Helpers: `getSessionId()`, `getSessionUrlSlug()`, `findSessionByUrlSlug()` (with legacy fallback), `listConferenceSessions()`.
2. **ConferenceDetail.tsx** session cards:
   - Title is now a `<Link>` to `/notebook/conference/{conf}/sessions/{urlSlug}` (real indexable URL).
   - Anchor IDs use `urlSlug` so `#anchor` jumping still works on the conference page itself.
   - GridSpeakerCard already linked correctly.
3. **SessionDetail.tsx**: dayJumpSessions, prev/next, back-link, canonical all use `urlSlug`. Note storage still keyed by `sessionId` (no orphaned notes).
4. **Session page**: legacy long URLs still resolve (`findSessionByUrlSlug` falls back). No 404s for old indexed URLs.

**JSON-LD enrichment:**
- **Conference page**: `Event` schema with `subEvent[]` (per session, with `performer`, `affiliation`), `location`, `organizer`, `startDate`/`endDate`. Plus `BreadcrumbList`.
- **Session page**: `Event` schema with `superEvent` link to conference, `performer` person, ISO `startDate`/`endDate` parsed from human date label, `location`. Plus `BreadcrumbList`.
- **Speaker profile**: `Person` schema with `jobTitle`, `worksFor`, `image`, `sameAs[]` (LinkedIn / website / podcast). Plus `BreadcrumbList`.

**Meta-tag enrichment** on session pages:
- Title format: `{Session Title} — {Speaker} · {Conference} {Edition}`
- Description: from session description with fallback
- Keywords: type, conference name, conference topic, speaker name, affiliation
- OG image: speaker photo when available
- Twitter card: summary_large_image with same image
- Canonical: clean URL slug

**Examples (all return 200, all have full SEO chrome):**
- `/notebook/conference/seo-week-2026/sessions/welcome-opening-remarks` (was 130 chars → now 27)
- `/notebook/conference/seo-week-2026/sessions/heo-the-hybrid-engine-score`
- `/notebook/conference/seo-week-2026/sessions/earned-architecture-for-ai-visibility`

Site-wide URL audit confirmed remaining routes are already clean: `/ai-updates/{slug}`, `/ai-contributors/{id}`, `/insights/{pillar}/{post}`, `/solutions/{slug}`, `/notebook/conference/speakers/{slug}`. Title template `%s · Venkata Pagadala` already applies suffix automatically.

### Iteration 21 — CMS for Posts with full SEO control (2026-02-27)
**User goal:** Push content updates without redeploys + every SEO knob editable per post.

**Backend (`/app/backend/server.py`):**
- New Pydantic models `PostSeo`, `PostUpsert`, `PostRecord` with: metaTitle, metaDescription, h1, canonical, ogTitle, ogDescription, ogImage, twitterCard, robotsIndex, robotsFollow, jsonLdType, slug, coverImage, status (draft/published/scheduled), publishAt, tags, date.
- 5 admin endpoints (JWT-protected): `GET/POST /admin/cms/posts`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /admin/cms/posts/{slug}`, `GET /admin/cms/pillars` (picker).
- Public `/api/content/posts*` now filters by `status: published` so drafts don't leak.
- Slug collision check returns 409.

**Frontend admin UI:**
- `/admin/cms/posts` (list) — search, filter by status & pillar, status pills, view-live + delete actions.
- `/admin/cms/posts/[slug]` (editor) — `slug=new` opens blank create form.
- 3 tabs: **Content** (excerpt + markdown body + 11-button toolbar incl. Image / Video / Quote / Task / Code), **Preview** (live render via `<NoteContent>`), **SEO** (full SEO form with character counts, OG image preview, SERP preview card).
- Sidebar: Status / Date / Publish-At / Pillar selector / Slug (auto-derived URL display) / Tags / Featured Image preview.
- Save Draft + Publish buttons in sticky toolbar.
- New `/admin/layout.tsx`; `Navbar` + `Footer` now hide on `/admin/*` paths for clean CMS chrome.

**SEO wiring (`app/insights/[slug]/[postSlug]/page.tsx`):**
- `generateMetadata` reads `seo.*` block from DB and emits: meta title/description, canonical, OG title/desc/image, Twitter card, robots index/follow.
- JSON-LD `@type` now driven by `seo.jsonLdType` (Article / BlogPosting / NewsArticle / WebPage / FAQPage); `image` field added.

**Result:** Edit/publish a post → public page reflects content + meta + canonical + OG + JSON-LD instantly, no redeploy. Verified end-to-end via Playwright (login → list 21 posts → create → markdown preview with image + YouTube embed → SEO tab → save).

**Test credentials:** `admin@monomind.com` / `MonoMind2026!` (unchanged).

### Iteration 20 — Production memory simulation + smart start script (2026-02-27)
**Honest measurement after 4 deploy failures:** Ran true cold-start simulation with backend running concurrently (matching K8s setup). Found peak combined RSS = **1132 MB** with 336 SSG pages → exceeds 1Gi pod by 108 MB → root cause of every 520 OOM.

**Fixes applied:**
1. **`frontend/scripts/start-prod.js`** (new file) — smart start wrapper:
   - If `.next/BUILD_ID` exists → skip build, run `next start` (warm path: ready in 200ms, peak 372MB)
   - If not → run `next build` with `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=450`, then `next start` (cold path: 30s, peak 957MB Node)
2. **`package.json` `start`**: simplified to `node scripts/start-prod.js` (no shell conditionals).
3. **Force-dynamic on heavy SSG routes** to drop pages 336 → 33:
   - `/notebook/conference/[slug]/sessions/[sessionId]` (was 91)
   - `/notebook/conference/speakers/[slug]` (was 78)
   - `/ai-contributors/[id]` (was 100)
   - `/ai-updates/[slug]`, `/insights/[slug]`, `/insights/[slug]/[postSlug]`
   - SEO preserved: bots get fully-rendered HTML on first hit; results cached by CDN/browser.
4. **`next.config.mjs`**: `experimental.cpus: 1`, `experimental.workerThreads: false`.

**Verified locally:**
- Cold start: 1132MB peak (would need >1Gi limit) but build completes successfully in 30s.
- Warm start: 372MB peak, ready in 200ms, easily fits in any pod size.
- All 7 critical routes (incl. dynamic ones): 200.
- Both `/health` and `/api/health`: 200.

**Outcome path:**
- IF Emergent docker phase pre-builds `.next/` → warm path triggers, 372MB peak, deploy succeeds.
- IF NOT → cold path runs at 1132MB. Fits if K8s limit is 1.5Gi+ (typical), OOMs if strict 1Gi.

### Iteration 19 — Deployment fix v2: memory-aware build at startup (2026-02-27)
**Actual root cause from second 520 failure:**
- Previous fix had `postinstall: "next build || true"` which ran during docker-build phase BEFORE K8s secrets (`NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` etc.) were injected. Next.js bakes `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` into JS bundles at build time → deployed app had empty BACKEND_URL → all client API calls failed → 520.
- Additionally: `next build` peak memory was **2.4GB RSS** for 336 SSG pages. Emergent K8s pod has 1Gi → OOM kill → CrashLoopBackOff → 17-min "stuck on Ready" gap → 520.

**Fixes applied:**
- `frontend/package.json`: `start` is now `NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=700' next build && next start -p 3000 -H 0.0.0.0`. Build runs at container startup (when K8s secrets ARE in process.env), then serves. No more `postinstall`.
- `frontend/next.config.mjs`: added `experimental.cpus: 1` and `experimental.workerThreads: false` to serialize SSG and reduce parallelism memory pressure.
- `frontend/app/experience/page.tsx`: marked `dynamic = "force-dynamic"` (heavy three.js/R3F/framer-motion components no longer in SSG path).
- Deleted Vite-era dead code: `src/App.tsx`, `src/main.tsx`.

**Memory impact:** Peak Node RSS during build dropped from **2.4GB → 977MB** (~60% reduction). Now fits within typical 1Gi pod headroom.

**Verified locally:**
- Fresh `rm -rf .next` then `supervisorctl restart frontend` → builds in 37s, ready in 199ms, all routes 200.
- Total cold-start time ~37s (well under K8s 17-min readiness window).

### Iteration 18 — Code review fixes (a/b/c) (2026-02-27)
Applied user-approved subset of code review:
- **(a) Empty catch blocks** → 5 instances in `SpeakerProfile.tsx`, `SessionDetail.tsx`, `ConferenceDetail.tsx` now log via `console.warn` (silent failures previously hidden bugs).
- **(b) Hardcoded test creds** → moved to `TEST_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `TEST_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars (with public defaults from `test_credentials.md`) across all 3 backend test files.
- **(c) Array `key={index}`** → 5 dynamic-list keys in takeaways/notes editors now use stable `${id}-${i}-${value-prefix}` composites (prevents reconciliation bugs on remove/add).
- **Skipped (d/e/f/g/h/i/j)** as documented: most were false positives (`is True` is idiomatic Python; `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for JSON-LD is the standard SEO pattern; "72 missing hook deps" pointed to non-hook lines).

**Verified:** `yarn build` succeeds (336 pages, 31s); all 23 backend conference notebook pytest cases pass; `/`, `/notebook/conference/seo-week-2026`, `/notebook/conference/speakers/mike-king`, `/admin/login` all return 200.

### Iteration 17 — REAL deployment fix (2026-02-27 / build logs analysis)
**Actual root cause from deployment build logs:** Both frontend and backend health checks at `https://github-checker-8.emergent.host` returned HTTP 520 (container never responded) for all 3 attempts. The container started but `next dev` (development mode) was attempting on-demand compilation of 336 SSG pages on first request, exceeding the 60-second health-check window.

**Fixes applied:**
- `frontend/package.json`:
  - `start` script changed from `next dev` to `next start -p 3000 -H 0.0.0.0` (production server — serves prebuilt `.next/` artifacts instantly).
  - Added `postinstall: "next build || true"` so the docker build phase runs `next build` after `yarn install`, populating `.next/` (with `BUILD_ID`) inside the production image.
- `backend/server.py`: Added a root-level `@app.get("/health")` endpoint (the deployment platform polls `/health` not `/api/health`). Returns `{ok, mongo, time}`.
- Removed all hardcoded preview URLs from source (`src/lib/site.ts`, 3 backend test files).
- Added `.limit()` to 7 unbounded MongoDB queries (`/notebook/notes/*`, `/content/pillars`, `/content/sitemap`).

**Local-dev tradeoff:** Supervisor still runs `yarn start` which now runs `next start` (production mode, no hot reload). For hot reload during development, run `yarn dev` directly or `rm -rf .next && yarn dev`.

**Verified:**
- Local: frontend ready in 228ms, all routes 200 (`/`, `/notebook/conference/seo-week-2026`, `/admin/login`, etc.)
- Backend: `/health` 200, `/api/health` 200, MongoDB ping OK
- Deployment-readiness check: status `pass`, zero findings.

### Iteration 16 — Deployment fix: hardcoded preview URLs removed (2026-02-27)
- **Root cause of "Deployment Failed"**: Hardcoded preview URL fallbacks in source code triggered Emergent's deployment preflight rejection.
- **Fixes applied**:
  - `frontend/src/lib/site.ts` — `SITE_URL` fallback no longer points to `https://github-checker-8.preview.emergentagent.com`; now falls back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` then empty string. Production env var must be set during deploy.
  - `backend/tests/test_api.py`, `test_auth_content_admin.py`, `test_conference_notebook.py` — removed hardcoded preview URL fallbacks; tests now require `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` env var (raise `RuntimeError` if absent).
- **Verified**: `yarn build` still succeeds, generates all 336 SSG pages cleanly. Frontend (HTTP 200) and backend (`/api/health` HTTP 200) healthy after restart.
- App is now ready to redeploy on Emergent native deploy.

### Iteration 15 — "From:" attribution + "My Notes" labeling (2026-04-26)
- **"From:" attribution always visible** in the SessionDetail "My notes" section — even in the empty state, before any note exists. Renders as: `From — [Conference Name + Edition] · [Session Title] · [Date] · [Speaker]`. Solves the "Mike King at 100 conferences, which one is this?" problem at every entry point.
- **"My Notes" button on conference-detail session cards** (renamed from "Quick note"):
  - When no note exists → `Add My Notes`
  - When note exists → `My Notes · {wordCount}w` with emerald accent
  - When note is published → also shows a globe icon
  - Visual prominence bumped: emerald accent for notes-with-content, prominent border + bg color
- All existing flows preserved: auth gate, autosave, publish toggle, markdown editor, time-jump strip.

### Iteration 14 — Markdown editor + media embeds (2026-04-26)
- Installed `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` + `rehype-raw`
- **`<NoteContent>` upgraded to render full Markdown** with custom components matching the brand's terminal/glow aesthetic:
  - Headings (H1→H2 / H2→H3 styled), `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `> blockquote`, `` `code` ``, code blocks, GFM tables, GFM strikethrough, GFM task lists
  - Bullet lists rendered with `→` prefix (matches `Suggested takeaways` style); ordered lists keep numerals
  - Images via `![](url)` rendered full-width with optional alt-caption
  - **Auto-embed for bare URLs**: YouTube → iframe, Vimeo → iframe, X/Twitter → link card, raw image URL → image
- **Editor toolbar in SessionDetail** with 9 quick-insert buttons: `B I H • " </> 🔗 🖼 ▶`
  - 🖼 prompts for image URL → inserts `![](url)` block
  - ▶ prompts for YouTube/Vimeo/X URL → inserts as auto-embed
  - 🔗 wraps selection as `[text](url)`
  - Standard markdown shortcuts wrap selection / insert at line start
- **Edit / Preview toggle** — click "Preview" to see fully-rendered markdown including embedded images and YouTube videos before publishing
- Tested live with a 313-word markdown note containing H2/H3, blockquote, bold, italic, bullet list, ordered list, code block, image, YouTube embed — all rendering correctly across SessionDetail full + ConferenceDetail preview + SpeakerProfile preview

### Iteration 13 — Long-form note rendering + conference attribution (2026-04-26)
- **NEW reusable `<NoteContent>` component** at `/app/frontend/src/components/NoteContent.tsx` — handles 200–3000+ word published notes with magazine-quality typography:
  - Reading width: `max-w-[68ch]`, line-height 1.85, 5-unit paragraph spacing
  - Auto word count + reading time (`748 words · 3 min read`)
  - **Conference attribution header** — "From: [Conference Name + Edition] · [Session Title] · [Date]" rendered as a clickable link → solves the "speaker at 100 conferences, which talk is this from?" problem
  - `preview` prop truncates to first ~200 words + "Read full notes →" CTA pointing to dedicated session page
  - Status badge + last-updated indicator
  - Takeaways block at the end (only in full mode)
- **Used in 3 contexts**:
  - ConferenceDetail session card → `preview` mode (200-word teaser + read-full link)
  - SpeakerProfile talk card → `preview` mode (avoids cluttering the timeline of all talks)
  - SessionDetail → full long-form rendering (the canonical reading experience)
- **Note editor** in SessionDetail bumped to `rows={26}`, line-height 1.85, font-size 13.5px, with live word/character counter beneath
- Tested with a real 748-word note on Mike King's Tech SEO Connect 2024 keynote — renders as a magazine article, not jammed mono-text

### Iteration 12 — Tech SEO Connect 2024 + per-session time-jump (2026-04-26)
- **NEW conference: Tech SEO Connect 2024** (Raleigh, NC). 18 sessions, 16 unique speakers. All sessions seeded with rich descriptions + my takeaways from the original Wix notes. Status: `attended`.
- **12 new speaker profiles**: Aleyda Solis, Rick Viscomi, JR Oakes, Kevin Indig, Rachel Anderson, Fili Wiese, Kristin Tynski, Dan Hinckley, Lazarina Stoy, Victor Pan, Serge Bezborodov, Patrick Stox. Photos cached locally + holographic treatment applied.
- Existing speakers (Mike King, Paul Shapiro, Noah Learner, Sam Torres, Jori Ford, Fabrice Canel) automatically pick up Tech SEO Connect appearances on their cross-conference timelines (`getSpeakerTalks`).
- **Per-session time-jump strip** — added to `SessionDetail.tsx`. Sticky horizontal strip showing every same-day session's start time. Click any → SSG navigation to that session. Current session highlighted. Skips break/meal/registration noise.
- Index page now shows: 3 conferences · 83 speakers · 48 hours of talks.
- New `PhotoSource` enum value: `techseo` (with `Photo · 6xmedia.wixstudio.com` attribution path).

### Iteration 11 — Auth restored + inline login pill (2026-04-26)
- **Backend auth restored** on `PUT/DELETE /api/notebook/notes/{slug}/{sid}` — anonymous writes return 401. Public GET now filters back to `is_public=true` only.
- **Floating Take-Notes pill** (bottom-right, on every conference/session/speaker page) — shows "Take Notes" when anon, "Notes Unlocked" (emerald) when logged in. Click → inline login modal (email + password) with no page redirect. Auto-broadcasts a `notebook-auth-changed` window event so editors site-wide unlock instantly without reload.
- **Editors are auth-gated again** — hidden for public visitors, visible+functional for the logged-in admin. Public visitors still see published field notes (read-only) on conference + session + speaker pages.
- Sidebar "Live Notes" card simplified: "Click any session to take notes — saves automatically. Toggle Public to publish."
- Existing admin credentials: `admin@monomind.com / MonoMind2026!` (stored in `/app/memory/test_credentials.md`). Token persists across reloads via localStorage.

### Iteration 10 — Open notes + simpler hero (2026-04-26)
- **Auth removed from notes endpoints** (`PUT/DELETE /api/notebook/notes/{slug}/{sid}`). Anyone with the URL can now write/edit notes — designed for fast capture during conferences, no login UX. Public GET endpoint also returns ALL notes (drops `is_public` filter — the toggle still controls whether notes render on speaker profile pages, not whether they exist in the API).
- **Hero CTAs simplified to 2 buttons**: `Agenda` + `Browse Speakers · {N}`. Removed "Sign in to take notes" entirely.
- **Venues section removed** from conference detail (also dropped from sidebar TOC). One less section to scroll past.
- **All note editors visible to everyone**: inline quick-note toggle on agenda + full long-form editor on per-session pages. No more "Notes locked" or "Sign in" prompts. Sidebar Live Notes card now reads: "Click any session to take notes — saves automatically. Toggle Public to publish on the speaker's profile."
- QA verified live: PUT works without Authorization header (200), 44 quick-note toggles visible without login, full editor opens on per-session page, autosave succeeds, all conference/profile/session pages 200.

### Iteration 9 — Consistent photo source + QA (2026-04-26)
- **All 39 SEO Week 2026 photos resourced from seoweek.org/speakers** (replaced the LinkedIn/seoweek mix). Locally cached at `/app/frontend/public/speakers/`. Visually cohesive after holographic treatment.
- **Botify Connect US 2024 photos** (28) sourced from 6xmedia.wixstudio.com (originally botify.com).
- Photo-source attribution beneath profile photo: `Photo · seoweek.org` for SEO Week, `Photo · botify.com` for Botify.
- New `PhotoSource` type + `photoSourceFor(slug)` helper in `speakers.ts`.
- QA verified live: 39/39 photos render, 12 time-slot jump buttons per day, holographic treatment consistent.

### Iteration 8 — All photos sourced + Botify Connect US 2024 conference (2026-04-26)
- **All 39 SEO Week 2026 photos sourced**: 25 from LinkedIn (via unavatar.io), 14 from seoweek.org. Photos cached locally at `/app/frontend/public/speakers/{slug}.{jpg|png|webp}`. New `localPhotoFiles` map in `speakers.ts` handles mixed extensions; `photoSourceFor(slug)` returns `linkedin | seoweek | fallback` for attribution display.
- **Photo source attribution** rendered under speaker hero photo on profile pages: `Photo · LinkedIn` or `Photo · seoweek.org`
- **NEW conference: Botify Connect US 2024** (Austin, TX). Added to `conferences.ts` with all 11 sessions, full descriptions, my takeaways per session, and 28 speakers. Status: `attended`. Renders at `/notebook/conference/botify-connect-us-2024` (SSG).
- **27 new speaker profiles** added to `speakers.ts` with bios, roles, LinkedIn, photos. New SSG count: **66 speaker profile pages** (39 SEO Week + 27 Botify, plus Zach Chahalis dedupes).
- **11 new session pages** auto-generated for Botify (`/notebook/conference/botify-connect-us-2024/sessions/[sessionId]`)
- Index page (`/notebook/conference`) now correctly shows: 2 conferences · 67 speakers · 40 hours of talks. Botify appears in "Field Notes" (attended) section.

### Iteration 7 — Photo source + nav + cleanup (2026-04-26)
- **Removed "Why It Matters"** section + sidebar TOC entry (was promotional copy)
- **Replaced all SEO-Week-branded photos** with LinkedIn-sourced via `unavatar.io/linkedin/{username}`. 25 photos cached locally at `/app/frontend/public/speakers/{slug}.jpg` for perf + ownership; the 14 unavatar couldn't fetch (rate-limited) render as on-brand DiceBear initials cards
- **Bigger photos**: HoloPhoto sizes bumped (sm 36→56px, md 48→80px, lg 64→112px, xl 128→160px) — applied across speakers grid, inline session chips, grid view tiles, profile heroes
- **Time-slot jump strip**: a sticky horizontal strip below day tabs shows every talk start time for the active day (`8:45 AM`, `9:00 AM`, …). Click → smooth-scrolls to that session anchor (12 slots/day). Skips registration/break/meal noise.
- All previous features preserved: JSON-LD `Event` + `Person` schemas, SSG (61 sessions + 39 speakers), per-session pages, publish toggle, etc.

### Iteration 6 — Holographic photo treatment (2026-04-26)
- New reusable `<HoloPhoto>` component (`/app/frontend/src/components/HoloPhoto.tsx`) — neutralizes vendor-branded image halos and applies the brand's terminal/glow aesthetic
- Effects (CSS in `app/globals.css`): grayscale + low-saturation base, cyan ambient glow + magenta accent gradient corners, animated scanlines, terminal corner brackets that grow on hover, hover state lifts the card and reveals full-color photo with cyan halo + chromatic-aberration on the speaker name
- Applied site-wide to every speaker image: conference detail speakers grid (39 cards), inline session speaker chips (40), Grid view tiles (40 large hologram squares), SpeakerProfile hero (square 260px), SessionDetail speaker hero (square 120px)
- All existing flows untouched — same hrefs, same testids; pure visual upgrade

### Iteration 5 — Per-session pages + hero CTAs (2026-04-26)
- New SSG dynamic route `/notebook/conference/[slug]/sessions/[sessionId]` — **61 pages pre-rendered**, one per speech
- New view `SessionDetail.tsx` with: session hero (type pill, time, day, theme) + speaker hero (photo, bio, LinkedIn, podcast, "Open profile" link) + Abstract + Suggested takeaways + **My Notes** long-form editor (rows=16, autosave 1.2s, status pills, publish toggle, takeaway chips) + Prev/Next session nav + JSON-LD `Event` schema
- Logged-out visitors see Notes Locked card (or published field notes if available)
- Conference detail page hero now shows prominent CTAs: **VIEW AGENDA** · **BROWSE SPEAKERS · 39** · **SIGN IN TO TAKE NOTES** (changes to TAKE NOTES when logged in)
- Every non-structural session card on the agenda has a clear **"Open session →"** button to its dedicated page (44 buttons total). The inline "Quick note" toggle is preserved alongside for fast capture.
- Grid view tiles now link to the per-session page (was: speaker profile) — better fit for note-taking flow
- Testing: 23/23 backend pytest pass · 100% frontend Playwright (autosave, publish, logout-public-render, prev/next, SSG, regression)

### Iteration 4 — Speaker profiles + publish toggle (2026-04-26)
- New `/app/frontend/src/data/speakers.ts` — 39 SEO Week 2026 speakers with photo (hot-linked from seoweek.org), bio, role, company, day track, LinkedIn, podcast URL
- New SSG route `/notebook/conference/speakers/[slug]` — 39 pre-rendered profile pages (Hero photo + bio + talks timeline + JSON-LD `Person`)
- Speaker model is **reusable across conferences**: `getSpeakerTalks(name)` aggregates all sessions a speaker has across `conferences.ts`. Future conferences will surface speakers' full timelines automatically.
- ConferenceDetail upgraded: speaker chip cloud → photo cards linking to profile pages; inline session speaker chip now also has photo + profile link
- New Timeline / Grid view toggle in the agenda — Grid view shows day-by-day photo tiles
- Backend: added `is_public` field to `conference_notes` + new public endpoint `GET /api/notebook/notes/public/{slug}` (no auth) returning only published notes
- Note editor now has a **Public/Private toggle** — flip a session's notes to public and they render inline on the conference detail page AND on the speaker's profile page
- PUT upsert preserves existing `is_public`/`status`/`takeaways` when those fields are omitted from payload (no accidental resets)
- Testing: 23/23 backend pytests pass; frontend Playwright verified all flows including end-to-end publish + public render after logout

### Iteration 3 — Conference Notebook (2026-04-26)
- Implemented SEO Week 2026 Conference Notebook template (user attending Apr 26–30, NYC)
- Refactored `/notebook/conference` index → uses real `conferences.ts` data (featured + upcoming + field notes)
- New SSG route `/notebook/conference/[slug]` with `generateStaticParams` (1 conference pre-rendered today, scales to N)
- New view `ConferenceDetail.tsx`: hero + stats, Why It Matters, Venues, 5-day sticky-tab timeline (61 sessions), 39-speaker chip cloud with anchors back to sessions, JSON-LD `Event` schema with sub-events
- Backend: collection `conference_notes`, unique index `(conference_slug, session_id)`, 3 admin-protected endpoints `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/notebook/notes/{slug}/{session_id}`
- Frontend live note editor (admin-only): per-session inline textarea with 1.2s debounced autosave, status pills (attended/skipped/revisit), takeaway chip input, `Last saved` indicator
- Public visitors see clean SSG agenda + JSON-LD; admin sees the editor on every non-structural session
- Testing: 16/16 backend pytest pass, frontend Playwright verified (39 chips, 101 cards, 44 editor toggles, end-to-end PUT + reload persistence)

### Iteration 1 — Migration (2026-04-19 early)
- Cloned source, wiped CRA, scaffolded Next.js 14 App Router with TypeScript
- Migrated all 19 routes into `app/` (server components → client page bodies)
- Shims: `src/lib/router-shim.tsx` (react-router-dom → next/navigation), `src/lib/helmet-shim.tsx` (no-op, metadata via Next API)
- Added `"use client"` to 100+ interactive components
- Fixed hydration mismatches (PageSidebar, ScrollReveal)
- Per-page `metadata` exports + global JSON-LD (Person + WebSite) in root layout
- Dynamic `sitemap.xml` + `robots.txt` (allows GPTBot, ChatGPT-User, OAI-SearchBot, ClaudeBot, Claude-Web, anthropic-ai, PerplexityBot, Perplexity-User, Google-Extended, Applebot-Extended, CCBot, Bytespider, Amazonbot, Meta-ExternalAgent, DuckAssistBot)
- FastAPI backend with contact + newsletter endpoints, unique email index, idempotent subscribe
- Backend tests: 26/26 pass (100%)

### Iteration 2 — Content + Auth + Admin + Email (2026-04-19 late)
- **Content → MongoDB**: seeded 100 AI contributors + 7 AI updates + 6 pillars + 21 blog posts via `/app/backend/seed_data/content.json` (generated from TS data files with `tsx` script)
- **Content API endpoints**: `/api/content/contributors[/id]`, `/api/content/updates[/slug]`, `/api/content/pillars[/slug]`, `/api/content/posts[/slug]`, `/api/content/sitemap`
- **Per-post metadata & JSON-LD**: slug pages (`/insights/[slug]/[postSlug]`, `/ai-updates/[slug]`, `/ai-contributors/[id]`, `/insights/[slug]`) now fetch from MongoDB in `generateMetadata` and render Article/Person + BreadcrumbList JSON-LD server-side
- **Expanded sitemap**: now includes 16 static + 7 updates + 100 contributors + 6 pillars + 21 posts = **150 URLs**
- **JWT auth**: `/api/auth/login` (bcrypt + JWT), `/api/auth/me`, `/api/auth/logout`; seeds admin user on startup (`admin@monomind.com`/`MonoMind2026!` from env)
- **Protected admin endpoints**: `/api/admin/overview`, `/api/admin/contact-submissions`, `/api/admin/newsletter-subscribers` (legacy `/api/contact/submissions`, `/api/newsletter/subscribers` also now require auth)
- **Admin UI** (`/admin/login` + `/admin`): login form, dashboard with 6 overview tiles, tabs for contacts/subscribers with expandable message rows, CSV export, sign-out. Stores token in localStorage, uses `Authorization: Bearer` header via `src/lib/admin-client.ts`
- **Resend email**: on contact submission fires async email to `CONTACT_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` (defaults to `vdepagadala@gmail.com`) via Resend. Gracefully no-ops when `RESEND_API_KEY` is empty (contact still saves)
- **Backend tests iteration 2**: 64/64 pass (100%) including bcrypt format verification

### Iteration 3 — SSG pre-rendering (2026-04-19 final)
- Added `generateStaticParams` + `revalidate = 3600` (ISR) to all 5 slug routes: `/ai-contributors/[id]` (100), `/ai-updates/[slug]` (7), `/insights/[slug]` (6), `/insights/[slug]/[postSlug]` (21), `/solutions/[slug]` (6) — **140 slug pages pre-rendered as static HTML at build time**
- `dynamicParams = true` on each so unknown slugs still render on-demand (no 404 for freshly-added content)
- Wrapped `{children}` in root-layout Suspense + fixed router-shim `useLocation` to stop calling `useSearchParams()` — eliminates CSR bail-out that was breaking SSG
- Renamed `src/pages/` → `src/views/` to prevent Next.js from auto-registering legacy Pages Router routes (removes duplicate `/About`, `/Home`, etc. URLs)
- Fixed `BlogPostPage` param mismatch (`pillarSlug` → `slug` to match `/insights/[slug]/[postSlug]` route)
- Production `next build` now completes cleanly: **163 static pages generated (140 SSG slug + 23 static)** with zero errors
- Sitemap-aware ISR: every hour Next.js refreshes `sitemap.xml` + slug HTML from MongoDB, so new content propagates without redeploy


## Backlog / Future

### P1 — Enable email notifications in production
Set `RESEND_API_KEY` in `/app/backend/.env` (get at https://resend.com/api-keys). If the `SENDER_EMAIL` domain isn't verified in Resend, emails only deliver to the verified owner's email — which is what we want here.

### P1 — Switch supervisor to `next start` for production
Currently supervisor runs `next dev` (hot-reload). Once you're happy with the content, switch the `start` script in `package.json` to `next start -p 3000 -H 0.0.0.0` and deploy; you'll serve the pre-rendered static HTML from `.next/` for maximum speed + perfect crawlability.

### P1 — Pre-render slug routes with `generateStaticParams` ✅ DONE (iteration 3)

### P2 — Admin CRUD for content
Currently admin only reads submissions. Extend UI + endpoints to edit contributors/updates/posts so owner doesn't need to redeploy to publish.

### P2 — Migrate remaining content files to DB
`aiEncyclopedia.ts` (1211 lines), `aiRoadmap.ts` (860 lines), `aiNotebook.ts` (269 lines), `crossLinks.ts` (209 lines). These are mostly taxonomy/static so lower SEO value than what's already migrated, but good for editability.

### P3 — Analytics + per-bot telemetry
Log UA parsing on every page hit so owner can see which AI/search bots are pulling what.

### P3 — Slack/Telegram contact webhook
Alongside email, fire a Slack or Telegram message per new contact submission.

### P3 — RSS feed from MongoDB
Current `/rss.xml` is static. Replace with dynamic route reading from `ai_updates` + `posts` collections.
